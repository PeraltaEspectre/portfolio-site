              I started to code very early in my life. I developed my first app in 5th grade of primary school. It was written in QBasic and based on the popular TV Show "Who wants to be a Millionaire".

              Ever since I was a little kid, I was very curious about the world. My favorite subjects in school were mathematics, physics, and programming. I also loved learning about astronomy.

              I became passionate about Web development after I graduated from college. I started spending a lot of my time online, on websites like TechCrunch and Hacker News. After seeing all those cool apps, innovative startups, and brilliant developers changing our technological landscape on a daily basis, I decided I wanted to become a part of that disruptive movement.
              <br/>
              <br/> 
              So in the last year and half I learned a lot of cool stuff related to front-end and back-end development. I used that knowledge to build my portfolio and this website. I know a lot about NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, jQuery, React, Redux, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai, Enzyme, HTML, CSS, CSS-in-JS, TDD, responsive design, progressive enhancement, graceful degradation, a11y, mobile-first design, continuous integration, code transpiling, module bundling, RESTful architecture, API's and more.

              I obtained a masters degree in electrical engineering with specializations in industrial automation and electrical machine design. I had the opportunity to work in the manufacturing industry for a couple of years. I designed power transformers, automation systems, programmed PLC's and commissioned large industrial facilities such as sawmills and tobacco warehouses.

                The most inspiring words I ever heard come from the mind of Carl Sagan. He also wrote one of my favorite SciFi novels called "Contact". His reflections are inspired by a photograph of our planet, made by the Voyager 1 space probe as it was leaving our solar system. The photograph is famously known as the "Pale Blue Dot".
