              I started to code very early in my life. I developed my first app in 5th grade of primary school. It was written in QBasic and based on the popular TV Show "Who wants to be a Millionare".

              Ever since I was a little kid, I was very inquisitive about the world. I used to come up with all sorts of conceptual problems that sharpened my critical thinking skills. During my education I enjoyed learning mathematics, physics and programming.

              I became passionate about Web Development after I graduated college. I learned a lot in the last few years, like how to develop modern web apps with the MERN stack. So I know my way around the server-side, although I feel more comfortable working on the client-side. 
              <br/>
              <br/> 
              I know a lot of cool stuff related to web development like NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, jQuery, React, Redux, Bootstrap, Mocha, Chai, Enzyme, HTML, CSS, CSS-in-JS, TDD, responsive design, progressive enhancement, graceful degradation, a11y, mobile-first design, declarative vs. imperative programming, continuous integration, code transpiling, code preprocessing or postprocessing, module bundling, RESTful architecture, API's etc.

              I obtained a Masters Degree in electrical engineering, with a focus towards automation and electrical machine design. 
              <br/>
              <br/> 
              It is a very challenging and interesting technical field in which I had the opportunity to work for a couple of years. I designed power transformers and complex automation systems. I've programmed PLC's and commissioned large industrial facilities such as sawmills and tobaco warehouses.
