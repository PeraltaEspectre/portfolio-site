              Ever since I was a little kid, I always preffered the science subjects in school. During those formative years, except spending my time just being a kid, I enjoyed learning mathematics, physics and coming up with all sorts of conceptual problems that sharpened my critical thinking skills.
              <br/>
              <br/> 
              I also loved the programming classes. They introduced me to the world of coding. I made my first, small app in 5th grade of primary school. It was written in QBasic and based on the popular TV Show "Who wants to be a Millionare".

              I've come along way from my QBasic school days. I've learned how to writte programs in low-level languages such as C (mostly for embedded systems), as well as in high-level languages such as Javascript or Python. I know how to develop modern, dynamic, responsive, progressive, a11y, fast web apps using the MERN stack. Here are some my skills:

              I knew I wanted to pursue an engineering degree while I was stil in elementary school. I have a practicaly oriented mindset and an affinity towards problem solving, so it always seemed like a natural choice.
              <br/>
              <br/> 
              I obtained a masters degree in electrical engineering, with a focus towards automation and electrical machine design. It is a very challenging and interesting technical field in which I had the opportunity to work for a couple of years. 
              <br/>
              <br/> 
              I designed power transformers and complex automation systems. I've programmed PLC's and commissioned large industrial facilities such as sawmills and tobaco warehouses.
